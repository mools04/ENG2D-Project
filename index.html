			<h1>Welcome, Friar Lawrence!</h1>
			<h2 id=head1>In this game you will become Friar Lawrence, a benedictine Monk in late 16th century Italy. </h2>
			<h2 id=head1>You have sworn an oath of cellebacy, and to do the work of god.</h2>

			<h2>As you are picking flowers for a potion, you say "Virtue itself turns vice, being missaplied,/ And vice sometime by action dignified." </h2>
			<h2>What you mean by this is that by doing the wrong thing, one can achieve the right outcome.</h2>
			<h2>Romeo, the sole son of the noble Montague family, comes to you with a request.</h2>
			<h2>He asks, "I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, /
	That thou consent to marry us to-day." </h2>
			<h2>The night before, young Romeo met Juliet. And to prove his deep love for her, he wants you to marry them.</h2>
			<h2>You respond with shock. </h2>
			<h2>"Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!/
	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,/
	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies/
	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes."</h2>

			<h2>You agree to marry them, hoping it will end the feud between the Montagues and the Capulets.</h2>
			<h2>"But come, young waverer, come go with me, / In one respect I'll thy assistant be; / For this alliance may so happy prove / To turn your households' rancour to pure love."</h2>
			<h2>Marrying the two without their parents' consent is wrong, but the right outcome may be achived.</h2>
			<h2>Romeo and Juliet are secretly married in your cell.</h2>

			<h2>You go to the Capulet's vault to be with Juliet when she wakes only to find Romeo lying down, dead in the tomb.</h2>
			<h2>You try to get Juliet to come with you, but she refuses. In fear of being arrested, you run away.</h2>

			<h2>Juliet goes to the doctor, and he tells her that she has too much blood.</h2>
			<h2>As you know, it is believed that all humans have four humours in their body that balance their personality and health.</h2>
			<h2>With too much blood in her system, Juliet has gone crazy and can't handle life.</h2>
			<h2>The doctor's solution is to place leeches on her body to suck out the excess blood.</h2>
			<h2>Instead of being placed in a tomb, Juliet is instead in her bed, recovering from the bloodletting.</h2>

			<h2>You return to the tomb, having been captured by the Third Watchman.</h2>
			<h2>The Prince enters, and forces you to explain the entire fiasco.</h2>
			<h2>You finish with "...if aught in this / Miscarried by my fault, let my old life / Be sacrific'd, some hour before his time, / </h2>
			<h2>Unto the rigour of serverest law."</h2>
			<p>The End.</p>
