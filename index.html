		<h2>As you are picking flowers for a potion, Romeo, the sole son of the noble Montague family, comes to you with an inquiry.</h2>
		<h2>He asks, "I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, /
That thou consent to marry us to-day." </h2>
<h2>You respond with shock. </h2>
<h2>"Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!/
Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,/
So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies/
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes."</h2>
